# Geolocate (IP Address Location locator)

# Geolocate is a script made for Termux
> Geolocate is made using bash. You can use Geolocate to locate address points of IP Addresses. Location given by Geolocate may not be exactly accurate but it will be close to the device assigned the ip address that you are searching for. We will be working on Geolocate to improve it by time!
